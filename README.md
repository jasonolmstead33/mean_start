MEAN STARTER
========================

This is my first attempt at creating a public starter pack for the MEAN stack. 

This project is using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js. 

Before executing `npm test` or `npm start` be sure you have Node.js installed and executable and your MongoDB up and running.

When first installing the project, be sure to install all dependencies, using `npm install`.

Current Status:

Initial setup of the registration and login forms, initial route setup, no working endpoints
